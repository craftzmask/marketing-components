# GreatFrontEnd — Fundamentals (HTML / CSS / JS)

This repo contains my solutions to [GreatFrontEnd Marketing Component Track](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/tracks/marketing) using **only**:

- **HTML** (semantics + accessibility)
- **CSS** (layout, responsive design, styling)
- **JavaScript** (DOM, events, async)

No frameworks, no build tools. The goal is to strengthen fundamentals.
